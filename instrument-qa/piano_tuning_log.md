# Piano Tuning Log – Upright & Grand Pianos  
**Technician:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Scope:** Mechanical and acoustic tuning (non-digital)  
**Piano Types:** Upright, Baby Grand, Full Grand  
**Environment:** Residential, Studio, and Live Event Prep  
**Period:** 2022–2025

## 🎯 Objective

To document field-based tuning and calibration of acoustic pianos post-transport. This includes pitch correction, hammer alignment checks, and post-move acoustic recalibration.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Piano tuning lever (high-torque)  
- Temperament strip  
- Rubber mutes  
- Pitch fork (A440)  
- Digital tuning app (for rough frequency targeting)  
- Cloth wedge + dust protector  
- Felt hammer stabilizer

## 🔧 Tuning Process Steps

1. **Initial Inspection**
   - [x] Remove outer board + fallboard  
   - [x] Confirm no broken strings  
   - [x] Check for hammer slant or loosened felts  
   - [x] Verify pedals activate damper lift properly

2. **Pre-Tune Stabilization**
   - [x] Wait 2+ hours post-move before tuning  
   - [x] Wipe down action mechanism  
   - [x] Verify humidity control system (if installed)

3. **Tuning Procedure**
   - [x] Temperament tuning in center octave  
   - [x] Octave alignment above + below  
   - [x] Unison correction (mute and blend string pairs/triples)  
   - [x] Verified pitch using tuning fork at A4 (440Hz)  
   - [x] Adjusted slack pins and tight coils when needed

4. **Post-Tuning Check**
   - [x] Played chromatic runs for pitch drift  
   - [x] Verified sustain pedal response  
   - [x] Noted keys with mechanical buzz or weak return  
   - [x] Ran silent pedal test (partial depression test)

## ⚠️ Common Post-Transport Tuning Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Low octave unstable | Soundboard shift during transport | Retuned after letting settle overnight |
| Treble drift | String tension imbalance | Fine-tuned next day for pitch lock |
| Double strike / weak return | Hammer action shifted | Adjusted knuckle + tightened flange |
| Muted note | Damper stuck or felt pinched | Freed mechanism + tested again |

## 🧠 Technician Notes

- Tuning immediately after transport = waste of time → **let piano rest first**  
- Uprights are more stable than grands, but show more pedal rod issues  
- Clients often can’t hear drift — but **I always verify full keyboard**  
- Digital tuners are for **reference**, not decision-making — always confirm by ear
