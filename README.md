## Overview

This repository documents my real-world work handling the disassembly, transport, reinstallation, and verification of high-value systems across multiple cities.

The systems I handled weren’t just relocated they were **powered down, disassembled, debugged, and brought back to life** with full functional validation. I applied field QA processes to ensure performance after relocation, with technical logs and SOPs developed from live jobsite experience.

## Systems Covered

- Smart Hot Tubs (electrical control boards, sensors, mobile app integration)  
- Electric Pianos (keybed calibration, ribbon cable alignment, audio output test)  
- Vending Machines (cooling units, sensors, UI, payment systems)  
- Acoustic Pianos (mechanical inspection, key & pedal alignment, full tuning)

## Visual Proof

All installs shown in this repo (hot tubs, pianos) were performed personally.  
See `/assets/` folders for live transport shots, including:

- Wrapped upright and grand pianos in transit  
- Onsite smart hot tub relocation photos  
- QA handling environments before and after setup

---

## Core Technician Processes

- Labeling and mapping of electrical cables before removal  
- Voltage confirmation and continuity testing pre/post reinstall  
- Cold-weather mitigation and moisture protection during delivery  
- Instrument tuning and action repair for relocated acoustic pianos  
- Logging every system failure with fix path and team sign-off

## Field QA Philosophy

> "QA doesn’t start at install — it starts at disconnect. If you don’t track it from teardown to test, you’re not guaranteeing anything.”

I’ve learned to treat every system as if I were rebuilding it for someone else to test. That mindset ensures cleaner installs, better results, and real technical confidence.
