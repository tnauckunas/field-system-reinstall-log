# Hot Tub Reinstallation Validation – Field QA  
**Technician:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Scope:** Standard and Smart Hot Tub Systems  
**Process:** Post-transport reassembly, wiring reconnection, systems testing, client sign-off  
**Locations:** Cross-city moves (UK + US)  
**Period:** 2022–2025

## Objective

To verify full functionality of relocated hot tub systems (including smart modules) after disassembly, transport, and reinstallation — ensuring safety, water-tight integrity, and system responsiveness.

---

## Tools Used

- Multimeter  
- Voltage pen tester  
- Heat gun (for seal shrink + panel test)  
- Bluetooth signal scanner  
- Infrared thermometer  
- Water pressure gauge  
- Smartphone (for app control test, if applicable)

## Reinstallation QA Checklist

### 1. **Power + Circuit Validation**
- [x] Breaker reconnected with voltage check  
- [x] No live exposure detected before power-up  
- [x] Main control board received steady voltage (~220–240V UK)  
- [x] No surge or short upon activation

### 2. **Control Panel + Smart System Test**
- [x] UI buttons responsive  
- [x] Display fully operational  
- [x] Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module powered and scanned via app  
- [x] Sensor array detected in settings menu

### 3. **Jet + Heater System**
- [x] Water filled to above intake  
- [x] Jet test (1 min low / 1 min high) = pass  
- [x] No leaks observed under skirt or panel  
- [x] Heater functional; temperature change validated  
- [x] Safety shutoff test successful (long-press power or lid sensor)

### 4. **App Integration (Smart Models Only)**
- [x] App installed on test device  
- [x] Unit paired + firmware confirmed  
- [x] Temp and lighting controls responsive  
- [x] Schedule and remote start verified  
- [x] Sync time under 15 sec from app to unit

## Regression Check

- Visual match of wiring based on original uninstallation photo  
- Ground line double-checked with continuity test  
- LED status light on board = green steady  
- Test water ran for 2+ hours on cycling mode  
- Thermal and pump logs stable, no spikes or faults

---

## Reinstallation Notes

- Insulated pump housing had to be reseated (thermal foam insert collapsed in transport)  
- Replaced one worn wire cap — added waterproof sealing gel  
- Board ribbon cable required reseating after failing initial power-on  
- Customer confirmed full operation at handover

---

## QA Lessons Learned

- Wiring diagrams save lives — without them, smart units become untraceable  
- Don’t test immediately after filling — **let system settle 10+ mins** before heating  
- Labeling + pre-photography = guaranteed reassembly integrity  
- Smart units need **dedicated module test** before declaring install complete
