## Objective

To ensure successful relocation and reinstallation of electric pianos, with full functional validation of keys, pedals, audio output, and power stability post-setup.

## Tools Used

- Multimeter (for power + fuse test)  
- Screwdrivers (wide/precision)  
- Static-safe gloves  
- Audio cable + headphones  
- Bench keyboard tester (where available)  
- Mobile app tuner / tone reference (for output test)

## Setup & Validation Checklist

### 1. **Physical Reassembly**
- [x] All casing panels reconnected and secured  
- [x] Keyboard locked in position, no lateral shift  
- [x] Pedal board connected and checked for continuity  
- [x] Music stand and external controls reattached

### 2. **Power Check**
- [x] Voltage confirmed at adapter terminal  
- [x] Fuse intact (visual + continuity test)  
- [x] Device powered on without delay  
- [x] No hum, static, or audible power issue

### 3. **Keybed Test**
- [x] Played all 88 keys (or full set)  
- [x] No stuck, muted, or uneven response keys  
- [x] Velocity sensitivity confirmed (soft press vs full press)  
- [x] Octave shift and function keys responsive  
- [x] Synth/voice swap buttons tested (if applicable)

### 4. **Audio Output**
- [x] Internal speaker test = clean playback  
- [x] Headphone jack tested with standard cable  
- [x] Aux Out tested (if model supports)  
- [x] Volume knob or slider responsive  
- [x] No crackle, buzz, or dropout

### 5. **Pedal Test**
- [x] Sustain pedal press = active hold  
- [x] Half-damper detection (if supported)  
- [x] Expression or soft pedal checked  
- [x] Secure connection (screw-in / TRS jack)

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Dead power adapter | Damaged in transport | Replaced + verified output |
| Stuck key | Debris lodged | Key removed + cleaned + reseated |
| Volume slider static | Dust in slider rail | Blown out + reseated internally |
| No pedal response | Wrong polarity setting | Switched to matching polarity |
| Speaker crackle | Loose wire from internal amp | Reseated connector harness |

---

## Notes

- Many digital pianos are sensitive to static → always ground before handling key contacts  
- Volume knobs often degrade with age – test at both low + high levels  
- Always verify function in both built-in speakers + headphones to confirm full output path  
- Pedals with reversed polarity = silent failure → always check this before assuming hardware fault
