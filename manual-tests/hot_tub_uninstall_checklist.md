# Hot Tub Uninstallation Checklist  
**Technician:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Scope:** Smart and standard hot tub systems  
**Process:** Full system shutdown, wiring disconnection, structural disassembly, transport preparation  
**Environment:** Residential / Commercial  
**Timeframe:** 2022–2025

## Objective

To safely and systematically uninstall hot tubs (standard + smart systems) while preserving all electrical components, cable routing, and water seals for successful transport and future reinstallation.

---

## Tools Used

- Standard electric toolset (multi-head screwdriver, drill, etc.)  
- Voltage tester + multimeter  
- Cable tags + zip ties  
- Plastic wrap, corner guards, moving blankets  
- Electrical tape + waterproof sealant  
- Heavy-duty hand truck + lift assistance

## Step-by-Step Test-Backed Checklist

### 1. **Power Shutdown Verification**
- [ ] Circuit breaker located + disabled  
- [ ] Voltage tested at power intake terminal = 0V  
- [ ] Main board switch disconnected

### 2. **Water System Drain**
- [ ] All jets opened  
- [ ] Gravity + pump drainage completed  
- [ ] Remaining water vacuumed from base  
- [ ] Moisture wiped from internal cable areas

### 3. **Cable Labeling & Disconnection**
- [ ] Photographs taken of terminal block & wiring  
- [ ] Each wire labeled (color + port) before removal  
- [ ] Low-voltage and heater terminals logged separately  
- [ ] Control panel connector pulled gently w/o bending pins

### 4. **Smart System Module Isolation**
- [ ] Bluetooth / Wi-Fi controller detached  
- [ ] Temp + pressure sensors unplugged  
- [ ] Fuse bank checked for burns  
- [ ] Module wrapped and boxed separately

### 5. **Structural Breakdown**
- [ ] Access panel removed  
- [ ] Tub skirt unscrewed (if detachable)  
- [ ] Jets secured with foam padding  
- [ ] Tub braced for upright lifting

### 6. **Transport Prep**
- [ ] All electronics wrapped and boxed  
- [ ] Cables coiled with tags outward  
- [ ] Hot tub plastic-wrapped + padded  
- [ ] Transport crew briefed on tilt zones and center weight

## Common Risks During Uninstallation

| Risk | Cause | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| Short circuit | Live wire mishandling | Multimeter use + double breaker check |
| Cracked control board | Dropping during removal | Secure packing + hand-off method |
| Missing wire map | Forgot to label during disassembly | Always photo + label in sequence |
| Sensor damage | Yanking out connected probes | Slow unplug w/ tag-pull system |

## QA Technician Notes

- Always log **initial system status** before shutdown (error codes, LED flashes)  
- Pre-take photo of terminal block = prevents reassembly mistakes  
- Smart tubs must have **separate box** for boards, sensors, and wireless module  
- Treat all systems as if they’ll be reinstalled by a different tech (clean handoff = clean reconfig)
