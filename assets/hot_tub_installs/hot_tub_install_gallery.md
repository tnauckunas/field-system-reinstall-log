## Uninstallation Process

### Before Removal

We began by opening the access panel and logging all board and wiring connections. Cables were labeled and photographed before disconnection.

### Electrical Disconnection

Cables were tagged and gently removed from the control board. Power was verified as off with multimeter.

## Physical Transport

### Relocation Phase

Hot tub was safely strapped, tilted with bracing, and transported across city zones without skirt or board damage.

## Reinstallation & Final QA

### Control Board Reconnection

Board reconnected using pre-labeled wires, terminal screws checked, and board booted for LED diagnostics.

### Power-On & LED Test

Successful startup — LED confirmed clean voltage input. No surge, flicker, or fault codes.

---

### Final Operational Check  
![Jets running during final test](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/hot_tub_installs/images/6.%20final_jet_test_under_pressure.jpg?raw=true)

System tested under water pressure, full jet output verified, no leaks or wiring issues.

---

## Outcome

- ✅ Verified clean uninstall  
- ✅ Zero damage during transport  
- ✅ Successful reinstallation  
- ✅ Power system confirmed operational  
- ✅ Jets, sensors, and smart board behavior all validated

All photos are of actual jobs I personally led and completed.
