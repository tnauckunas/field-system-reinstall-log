## 🚚 Delivery & Setup

### 📦 Arrival at Job Site  
![Photo booth positioned at club install location](../assets/vending_machines/photo_booth_positioned.jpg)  
Transported the entire system from warehouse to a high-traffic nightclub in downtown San Diego. Booth was secured upright, all boxed peripherals and electrical components pre-packed internally.

### ⚠️ Unexpected System Error  
![Startup screen showing runtime exception crash](../assets/vending_machines/boot_error_runtime_exception.jpg)  
Upon powering on, the booth displayed a .NET runtime crash and failed to load UI. Online manuals were inaccessible. I directly contacted the manufacturer and followed real-time guidance for registry file repair and reboot sequencing.

## 🛠 Hardware Validation

### 🖨️ Printer Assembly

Unboxed, mounted, and loaded the internal thermal printer. Verified that paper feeds correctly and ribbon was aligned. Test print executed later to validate full photo flow.
