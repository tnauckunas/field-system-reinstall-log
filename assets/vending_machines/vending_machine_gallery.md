## 🚚 Delivery & Setup

### 📦 Arrival at Job Site

Transported the entire system from warehouse to a high-traffic nightclub in downtown San Diego. Booth was secured upright, all boxed peripherals and electrical components pre-packed internally.

### 🧰 Internal Wiring Audit

Prior to power-up, confirmed all internal USB, power, and sensor cables were pre-packaged correctly. Ran a full hardware check using boot diagnostics menu.

### ⚠️ Unexpected System Error

Upon powering on, the booth displayed a .NET runtime crash and failed to load UI. Online manuals were inaccessible. I directly contacted the manufacturer and followed real-time guidance for registry file repair and reboot sequencing.

## 🛠 Hardware Validation

### 🖨️ Printer Assembly  
![Photo printer mechanism inside booth](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/vending_machines/3.%20printer_mechanism_loaded.jpg?raw=true)
Unboxed, mounted, and loaded the internal thermal printer. Verified that paper feeds correctly and ribbon was aligned. Test print executed later to validate full photo flow.

### 📷 Final QA – Output  
![Printed photo strip showing user test](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/vending_machines/5.%20test_print_pass.jpg?raw=true)

Completed a full internal test sequence. Photobooth captured four test shots, printed on site. Verified UI response, camera lens clarity, screen prompts, and payment flow (cash/card emulation).
