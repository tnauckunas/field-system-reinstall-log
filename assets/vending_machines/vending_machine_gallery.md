### Residential Pickup – Photo Booth Transport

This photo booth system was picked up from a residential location. We loaded and transported the boxed units using a rented U-Haul trailer, with custom strap tensioning to maintain upright balance during city driving. Each booth weighed over 300 lbs and required load shifting mitigation to prevent roll or tilt. Destination was a high-traffic nightclub in downtown San Diego.

### Internal Wiring Audit

Prior to power-up, confirmed all internal USB, power, and sensor cables were pre-packaged correctly.

## Hardware Validation

### Printer Assembly

Unboxed, mounted, and loaded the internal thermal printer. Verified that paper feeds correctly and ribbon was aligned. Test print executed later to validate full photo flow.

### Unexpected System Error

Upon powering on, the booth displayed a .NET runtime crash and failed to load UI. Ran a full hardware check using boot diagnostics menu as online manuals were inaccessible. I directly contacted the manufacturer and followed real-time guidance for registry file repair and reboot sequencing.

### Final QA – Output

Completed a full internal test sequence. Photobooth captured four test shots, printed on site. Verified UI response, camera lens clarity, screen prompts, and payment flow (cash/card emulation).

### Final Staging – Nightclub Installation

Captured during the final staging phase. At this point, all internal wiring, print verification, and lighting system diagnostics had been completed. Screen prompts and camera UI were functioning as expected. The booth was installed upright inside a nightclub venue, secured in a space-constrained area with public access. One assistant assisted in wheeling both units using a dolly during entry, as seen placing the top signage in this photo. All system wiring, QA testing, and staging validation were performed by me.

### Ice Cream Vending Machine – Mall Deployment

This was a separate job where I handled the relocation and setup of a commercial ice cream vending machine. Much like the photobooth, I secured the unit for vertical movement using load straps and stabilizers. This job required tight navigation through a freight access corridor and lift. I conducted a visual inspection on internal wiring, compressor vents, and power terminal before final placement. Although different from the photo unit, the same QA process was applied: verify cabling, power stability, and interface boot success.

## Final Outcome

- Delivered on time  
- Problem-solved a software failure without documentation  
- Completed installation with manufacturer on-call  
- Verified printer, camera, UI, and payment system  
- Real print output in hand = job verified complete

## Technician’s Note:

Commercial machines like these aren’t “plug-and-play.”  
They’re multi-system, failure-prone, and frequently undocumented.  
I treat every install like it's my name on the invoice because it is.
