## Delivery & Setup

### Arrival at Job Site

Transported the entire system from warehouse to a high-traffic nightclub in downtown San Diego. Booth was secured upright, all boxed peripherals and electrical components pre-packed internally.

### Internal Wiring Audit

Prior to power-up, confirmed all internal USB, power, and sensor cables were pre-packaged correctly.

## Hardware Validation

### Printer Assembly  
![Photo printer mechanism inside booth](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/vending_machines/3.%20printer_mechanism_loaded.jpg?raw=true)

Unboxed, mounted, and loaded the internal thermal printer. Verified that paper feeds correctly and ribbon was aligned. Test print executed later to validate full photo flow.

### Unexpected System Error  
![Startup screen showing runtime exception crash](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/vending_machines/4.%20boot_error_runtime_exception.jpg?raw=true)

Upon powering on, the booth displayed a .NET runtime crash and failed to load UI. Ran a full hardware check using boot diagnostics menu as online manuals were inaccessible. I directly contacted the manufacturer and followed real-time guidance for registry file repair and reboot sequencing.

### Final QA ‚Äì Output  
![Printed photo strip showing user test](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/vending_machines/5.%20test_print_pass.jpg?raw=true)

Completed a full internal test sequence. Photobooth captured four test shots, printed on site. Verified UI response, camera lens clarity, screen prompts, and payment flow (cash/card emulation).

### üç¶ Ice Cream Vending Machine ‚Äì Mall Deployment  
![Ice cream vending machine being secured for mall installation](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/vending_machines/6.%20ice_cream_machine_mall_deploy.jpg?raw=true)  

This was a separate job where I handled the relocation and setup of a commercial ice cream vending machine. Much like the photobooth, I secured the unit for vertical movement using load straps and stabilizers. This job required tight navigation through a freight access corridor and lift. I conducted a visual inspection on internal wiring, compressor vents, and power terminal before final placement. Although different from the photo unit, the same QA process was applied: verify cabling, power stability, and interface boot success.

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome

- Delivered on time  
- Problem-solved a software failure without documentation  
- Completed installation with manufacturer on-call  
- Verified printer, camera, UI, and payment system  
- Real print output in hand = job verified complete
