## Before Removals

### Grand Piano Inspection

Checked keybed, hammer action, and pedal condition before wrapping. Strings were stable; no felt drag or hammer warp.

### Upright Piano Inspection

Inspected damper mechanism, pedal rod clearance, and casing for loose panels or cracked veneer before move.

## Relocation Phase

### Upright Grand – Manual Stair Lift Strategy

This 900 lb upright grand was moved with a custom 2-person strategy I developed on-site. I rigged two high-mounted straps to act as anchor points. While I lifted the piano a step at a time using legs and back for force, my partner ascended and re-tensioned the straps at each interval using a ratchet system. This offloaded pressure and created resting phases to prevent slip or fatigue. It took roughly 1 hour to complete, maintaining full control over the center of gravity throughout.

## Reinstallation & QA

### Pre-Assembly Setup

The grand piano has been delivered and set into its final location. At this stage, two outer legs are ready to be attached while the piano is carefully lowered. The third leg will be attached and finally the pedal lyre will be mounted last to complete structural assembly before testing.

### Upright Final Check

With the piano fully assembled and stabilized in its final position, we began the post-install testing process. Pedals were connected and functionally verified, leg base leveled, and hammer return tested on seven random keys. Sustain pedal clearance was adjusted, and we confirmed damper lift on all three pedals. Key return on the center octave was smooth, and the backboard was locked into final position. Unit was cleared for post-install tuning.

### Pedal Rod Final QA

Adjusted rod length and node clearance using rotation tool. Verified full depression with no bounce-back or slip.

## ✅ Outcomes

- Upright + Grand models both successfully relocated  
- No mechanical damage, skipped hammers, or pedal misalignment  
- Ready for tuning or client sign-off

All photos taken during real jobs I personally worked on.
