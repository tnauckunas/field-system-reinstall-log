## 🔍 Before Removals

### 🎹 Grand Piano Inspection

Checked keybed, hammer action, and pedal condition before wrapping. Strings were stable; no felt drag or hammer warp.

### 🎼 Upright Piano Inspection

Inspected damper mechanism, pedal rod clearance, and casing for loose panels or cracked veneer before move.

## 🚚 Relocation Phase

### 📦 Mid-Transit Handling  
![Upright piano staged mid-relocation](../assets/piano_installs/3_relocation_midpoint.jpg)  
Piano was wrapped, braced, and positioned upright for stair lift navigation. Balance and tilt kept to center mass to protect pedal interface.

## 🛠 Reinstallation & QA

### 🔧 Grand Piano Reinstalled  
![Grand piano post-move, being re-assembled](../assets/piano_installs/4_grand_post_reinstall.jpg)  
Pedals reconnected, leg base leveled, and hammer return tested on 7 random keys. Pedal felt was trimmed for clearance on sustain lift.

### 🎯 Upright Final Check  
![Upright piano stabilized, pre-tuning](../assets/piano_installs/5_upright_pre_tuning.jpg)  
Tested key return on center octave, damper lift confirmed on all 3 pedals, backboard alignment locked into position.

### 🧰 Pedal Rod Final QA  
![Close-up of upright pedal rod fitment](../assets/piano_installs/6_pedal_rod_clearance.jpg)  
Adjusted rod length and node clearance using rotation tool. Verified full depression with no bounce-back or slip.

## ✅ Outcomes

- Upright + Grand models both successfully relocated  
- No mechanical damage, skipped hammers, or pedal misalignment  
- Ready for tuning or client sign-off
