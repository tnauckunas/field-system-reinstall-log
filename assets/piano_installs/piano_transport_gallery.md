## Before Removals

### Electric Grand Piano Inspection

This was an electric grand piano inspected before disassembly and transport. I checked keybed, hammer action, and pedal interface for responsiveness. Power was tested to confirm full functionality. All electrical inputs were safely unplugged and cable ports sealed before wrapping. This step was crucial to verify the system was damage-free and fully operational prior to move and protecting both client expectations and company liability.

### Upright Player Piano Inspection  
![Upright piano checked before transport](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/piano_installs/images/2.%20antique_upright_player_inspection.jpg?raw=true)

This was a rare antique player piano requiring careful inspection before disassembly and relocation. I assessed the damper mechanism, pedal rod clearance, and casing integrity, taking extra care to check for loose panels or hairline veneer cracks. The internal paper roll housing and tracking system were noted as intact. Because of the piano’s age and uniqueness, all handling steps were pre-planned to avoid vibration damage or mechanical shift during transport.

## Relocation Phase

### Upright Grand – Manual Stair Lift Strategy 
![Upright piano staged mid-relocation](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/piano_installs/images/3.%20Upright%20grand%20braced%20and%20upright%20%E2%80%93%20900%20lb%20lift.jpg?raw=true)

This 900 lb upright grand was moved with a custom 2-person strategy I developed on-site. I rigged two high-mounted straps to act as anchor points. While I lifted the piano a step at a time using legs and back for force, my partner ascended and re-tensioned the straps at each interval using a ratchet system. This offloaded pressure and created resting phases to prevent slip or fatigue. It took roughly 1 hour to complete, maintaining full control over the center of gravity throughout.

## Grand Piano – Trailer Loading Strategy (900 lbs)

This 900 lb grand piano was unstable on the ramp and at high risk of tilting backward and endangering my teammate and the piano. I developed a workaround using a top wrap-around strap for upward control, and anchored a yellow cross strap to hold the piano downward as we pushed. This allowed us to move the load up the ramp while preventing backward lean or rebound. A 2-man job completed with zero risk, using adaptive load physics and anchored strap sequencing.

## Reinstallation & QA

### Pre-Assembly Setup

The grand piano has been delivered and set into its final location. At this stage, two outer legs are ready to be attached while the piano is carefully lowered. The third leg will be attached and finally the pedal lyre will be mounted last to complete structural assembly before testing.

### Upright Final Check

With the piano fully assembled and stabilized in its final position, we began the post-install testing process. Pedals were connected and functionally verified, leg base leveled, and hammer return tested on seven random keys. Sustain pedal clearance was adjusted, and we confirmed damper lift on all three pedals. Key return on the center octave was smooth, and the backboard was locked into final position. Unit was cleared for post-install tuning.

### Pedal Rod Final QA

Adjusted rod length and node clearance using rotation tool. Verified full depression with no bounce-back or slip.

## ✅ Outcomes

- Upright + Grand models both successfully relocated  
- No mechanical damage, skipped hammers, or pedal misalignment  
- Ready for tuning or client sign-off
