## Before Removals

### Grand Piano Inspection

Checked keybed, hammer action, and pedal condition before wrapping. Strings were stable; no felt drag or hammer warp.

### Upright Piano Inspection

Inspected damper mechanism, pedal rod clearance, and casing for loose panels or cracked veneer before move.

## Relocation Phase

### Mid-Transit Handling

Piano was wrapped and on the piano board, braced, and positioned upright for stair lift navigation. Balance and tilt kept to center mass to protect pedal interface.

## Reinstallation & QA

### Grand Piano Reinstalled

Pedals reconnected, leg base leveled, and hammer return tested on 7 random keys. Pedal felt was trimmed for clearance on sustain lift.

---

### Upright Final Check  
![Upright piano stabilized, pre-tuning](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/piano_installs/5.%20grand_pre_tuning.jpg?raw=true)
Tested key return on center octave, damper lift confirmed on all 3 pedals, backboard alignment locked into position.

---

### Pedal Rod Final QA  
![Close-up of upright pedal rod fitment](https://github.com/tnauckunas/field-system-reinstall-log/blob/main/assets/piano_installs/6.%20Pedal_rod_clearanc.jpg?raw=true)

Adjusted rod length and node clearance using rotation tool. Verified full depression with no bounce-back or slip.

## ✅ Outcomes

- Upright + Grand models both successfully relocated  
- No mechanical damage, skipped hammers, or pedal misalignment  
- Ready for tuning or client sign-off

All photos taken during real jobs I personally worked on.
