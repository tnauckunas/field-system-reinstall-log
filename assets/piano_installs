## ðŸ§  Notes

- All photos shown are of **real pianos I worked on directly**  
- Pianos shown were tuned and tested by ear (A440), including sustain and key action  
- Physical configuration, pedal recalibration, and mechanical response were verified post-move  
- These images support logs in:
  - [`electric_piano_setup_log.md`](../manual-tests/electric_piano_setup_log.md)  
  - [`piano_tuning_log.md`](./piano_tuning_log.md)
