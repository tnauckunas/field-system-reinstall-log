# Piano Mechanical + Sensor Issues Log  
**Technician:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Scope:** Electric and standard grand piano transport + reinstallation  
**Issue Type:** Mechanical key sticking, pedal sensor misalignment  
**Period:** 2022–2025

## 🎯 Objective

To track and resolve physical and sensor-related failures found during or after piano relocation, especially in electric grand models with pedal input systems and acoustic grands with sensitive keybeds.

## 🎹 Common Issues & Fixes

| Type | Symptom | Root Cause | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| Pedal no sound | Pedal connected, but no sustain or expression | Sensor rod not aligned with node | Rod re-lengthened + node recalibrated |
| Pedal fails on first press | Intermittent contact | Slight tilt in base panel shifts alignment | Adjusted angle, retightened bolts, retested |
| Sticky key (standard) | Single note won’t fully release | Lateral pressure from travel vibration | Moved surrounding keys outward, loosened action |
| Sticky key (electric) | Unresponsive digital keypress | Sensor layer lifted or warped | Opened keybed, reseated rubber/sensor strip |
| Double strike | Key triggers twice when pressed once | Dirty contact pad | Cleaned pad + rebalanced travel distance |

## 🛠 Diagnostic Flow

1. Test every key and pedal using headphones + internal speaker  
2. Visually inspect keybed and pedal contacts  
3. Look for uneven key spacing, which often indicates pressure shifts  
4. Disassemble bottom panel (for grands) if pedal signal fails  
5. Recalibrate rod → node length (especially on high-end Yamahas/Kawais)

## 🧪 Field Notes

- Pedal rods often arrive slightly retracted after move — always check travel distance against physical bottom node  
- Reversing a few keys laterally (physically pushing left/right) **often resolves sticking** caused by minor impact warping  
- Failing to test with both speakers + headphones = missed diagnosis  
- Weight shift during van braking can cause **base plate torque** = pedal error

## 🧠 QA Takeaways

- Mechanical testing matters even in digital hardware  
- Post-transport **residual pressure** can fake electrical failure  
- “No sound” is often **not an electrical issue — it’s geometry**
