# Cable Replacement & Wiring Issues Log  
**Technician:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Scope:** Field reinstallations of smart hot tubs, electric pianos, vending machines  
**Type:** Power cables, ribbon cables, signal lines, thermal fuses  
**Period:** 2022–2025

## 🎯 Objective

To document real-world cable failures and replacement scenarios during reinstall jobs — especially those caused by transport stress, misrouting, wear, or unverified compatibility. Each log includes resolution and updated preventive steps.

## ⚠️ Common Cable Failures & Fixes

| System | Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|--------|-------|------------|-----|
| Hot Tub | No control panel power | Cable pin bent on board during reinstall | Removed, reshaped, reinserted |
| Hot Tub | Heater short | Cable cracked during cold storage | Replaced with insulated high-flex model |
| Electric Piano | No audio from speakers | Ribbon cable loose from main board | Resocketed and secured with shield tape |
| Electric Piano | Random key cutoff | Signal cable stress under base | Replaced and rerouted with anti-crimp path |
| Vending Machine | Display flickering | Power line pinched at hinge panel | Rerouted cable path, padded interior edge |
| Vending Machine | Card reader unresponsive | Power/data line swapped during setup | Consulted diagram, reconnected to correct ports |

## 🛠 Diagnostic Process

- Power check at endpoint (multimeter)  
- Cable tracing from input to logic board  
- Cross-check against pre-uninstall photos  
- Pin / socket inspection under light  
- Continuity test (where safe)  
- Swap test with working cable (if possible)

---

## 🔁 Prevention Protocol Added

- All cables now labeled with color + destination  
- Pre-uninstall photo requirement added to SOP  
- Ribbon cables not twisted — always flat or looped gently  
- Power bricks stored in hard casing with wrap guard  
- Added checklist: “Wiring verified before power-up”

## 🧠 Technician Insight

- A bad cable costs time, but a **mismatched cable kills systems**  
- Heat, cold, bending, and pressure all create **invisible cable fatigue**  
- Most failures are **not the board — they're between the board and the source**  
- Treat every cable as **mission-critical** until proven stable
