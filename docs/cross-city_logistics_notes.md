# Cross-City Logistics Notes – Technical Transport  
**Technician:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Scope:** High-value system relocation: smart hot tubs, electric pianos, vending machines  
**Route Types:** Suburban → Urban, Long-Distance Highway, Multi-stop Delivery  
**Period:** 2022–2025

## Objective

To summarize strategic notes, real-world lessons, and QA insights gathered while relocating delicate electronic systems across cities. These notes helped reduce system damage, transport stress, and reinstall delays — especially for smart systems sensitive to power, shock, and temperature.

## Real-World Hazards Encountered

| Hazard | System Impact | Preventive Action |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Cold weather (winter) | LCD panels crack / smart modules glitch | Thermal wraps + delay startup 1 hr post-unload |
| Rain during offload | Panel moisture, fuse short | Rain canopy + zip-sealed electrical covers |
| Vibration fatigue | Loose ribbon cables in pianos & vending | Stabilizer foam + tension reduction under frame |
| Delivery stacking | Hot tub side skirt cracked | Never stack near hydraulic skids / tilt-prone walls |
| No elevator access | Floor drag risks on vending machines | Added rolling plates + elevated panel guards |

## Packing + Loading Protocol Notes

- Always strap **electronics on outer edge**, not centered  
- Confirm **tie-down points away from cables** and circuit zones  
- Remove detachable UI/control boards before transport  
- Power adapters stored in padded labeled bag per unit  
- Label panels **visible on all sides** — especially hot tubs and vending backs

---

## Communication Tactics

- Call ahead: verify **access width, stairs, ramps, lift capacity**  
- Log any delays on job sheet with reason + mitigation  
- Notify destination client of **cool-down time** before first use  
- Never assume 2-man lift is enough for smart systems — **weight ≠ complexity**

## QA-Tech Lessons Learned

- Transport is **part of the QA lifecycle** — damage begins at the tie-down, not the reinstall  
- Environmental sensitivity (temperature + humidity) must be tracked per system type  
- Success = good labeling, good packing, and good client communication — not just clean delivery
