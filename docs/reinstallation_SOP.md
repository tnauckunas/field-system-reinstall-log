# Transport Damage Log – Field Equipment Moves  
**Technician:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Scope:** Hot tubs, electric pianos, vending machines (cross-city logistics)  
**Role:** Lead tech for uninstall, secure packing, relocation, and reinstall  
**Period:** 2022–2025

## 🎯 Objective

To document equipment damaged during transport or disassembly/reassembly, and to identify failure points, contributing factors, and preventative actions across multiple categories of high-value systems.

---

## 📦 Devices Tracked

- Smart Hot Tubs (electrical panels, control boards, skirt panels)  
- Electric Pianos (pedals, keybeds, ribbon cables, power systems)  
- Vending Machines (cooling units, screens, motors, coin/card readers)

## ⚠️ Common Transport-Related Damage

| Device Type | Issue | Root Cause | Resolution |
|-------------|-------|------------|------------|
| Hot Tub | Control panel wire severed | Yanked during lifting phase | Rewired and shielded in future jobs |
| Hot Tub | Side skirt cracked | Poor padding against truck side | Added foam corner shields |
| Electric Piano | Pedal signal loss | Cable stress under base | Rerouted cable + reinforced post-install |
| Electric Piano | Power flicker | Loose adapter seating after jostle | Replaced cable, zip-tied post test |
| Vending Machine | UI ribbon cable loose | Dropped slightly during handoff | Reconnected, added stabilizer foam |
| Vending Machine | Cracked compressor guard | Improper strap pressure | Added inner bracing board on next load |

## 🛠 Damage Prevention Measures Implemented

- Used photo logs of internal cable routing pre-uninstall  
- Switched from basic blankets to foam-backed tech covers  
- Applied zip ties + tags to every removable wire  
- Trained movers to respect tilt zones and wiring tolerance  
- Added in-transit shock absorbers under pallets (for vending machines)  
- Developed shared checklist for drivers and installers

---

## 🔁 Ongoing QA Recommendations

- Every reinstallation begins with:
  - Cable integrity check  
  - Voltage confirmation at terminals  
  - LED or diagnostic screen test  
  - Comparison against uninstall condition photos  
- If system fails post-move, re-run full diagnostic BEFORE contacting vendor

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- 90% of post-transport failures could be traced to **avoidable cable stress or pressure points**  
- Labeling, photos, and shielded wiring = future-proof reinstall success  
- Standard moving crew processes often miss hidden technical fragility — QA needs to **own packing protocols**
