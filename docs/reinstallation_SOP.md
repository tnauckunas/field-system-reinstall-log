# Reinstallation SOP – Field QA Protocol  
**Author:** Tomas Nauckunas  
**Scope:** Smart hot tubs, electric pianos, vending machines  
**Function:** Define repeatable, safe, and QA-verified reinstallation workflow  
**Period Implemented:** 2022–2025

## Purpose

To ensure every reinstallation is performed with maximum safety, technical accuracy, and post-transport system integrity minimizing risk of component damage, client dissatisfaction, or power failure.

This SOP was built through repeated execution, troubleshooting, and post-move feedback logs.

## Step-by-Step Reinstallation Workflow

---

### 1. **Physical Reassembly**
- Unwrap components carefully; log any visible damage
- Confirm all hardware (brackets, panels, legs, mounts) is present
- Begin reassembly on level ground or flat foundation
- Secure all screws, bolts, clamps per original configuration

---

### 2. **Electrical Preparation**
- Verify voltage at target outlet with multimeter
- Confirm ground line is present and stable
- Inspect power cable for wear, pinching, or exposure
- Route all cables to avoid bends or stress points
- Connect only after visual inspection of control board and fuse

---

### 3. **System-Specific Config**

#### Hot Tubs
- Reconnect internal wires by label or photo reference
- Secure thermal sensor, pump wiring, and LED strip ports
- Wait 10–15 minutes after water fill before heater test

#### Electric Pianos
- Keybed connection first  
- Ribbon cable second  
- Power last — test keys before attaching pedals

#### Vending Machines
- Plug in screen/control panel first  
- Connect cooling unit  
- Run test cycle with dummy item  
- Confirm payment interface and drop tray sensor respond

---

### 4. **Functional Validation**
- Power-on diagnostic check (voltage, LED, or app status)
- Perform per-device QA checklist (see specific `.md` logs)
- Document status and sign-off
